 Spotify playlist project

About this project:

My friend Zsoli and I have very different tastes in music. We wanted to create a spotify playlist that combines
some of our music based on the following criteia:

Primary requirements:
Zsoli's:
- no rock
- maximize energy and danceability from spotify's metadata

Noah's: 
- keep all jazz
- no country
- keep all indie music

Secondary requirements:
- prefer songs less than 4 minutes
